3. **What Could Be Improved**
   | Category | Issue | Root Cause | Improvement Action |
   |----------|-------|------------|-------------------|
   | [Process/Technical/Team] | [Description] | [Analysis] | [Specific action] |

4. **Technical Debt Identified**
   - New debt incurred
   - Debt addressed
   - Priority for remediation

5. **Process Improvements**
   - Workflow changes recommended
   - Tool improvements needed
   - Communication enhancements

6. **Knowledge Transfer**

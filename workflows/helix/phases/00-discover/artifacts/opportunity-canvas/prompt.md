- Competitive advantage

## Key Principles

### 1. Problem First
- Start with customer pain, not solution
- Validate the problem exists and matters
- Quantify the impact if possible

### 2. Be Specific About Customers
- Name exact customer segments
- Understand their context
- Know their alternatives

### 3. Define Clear Success
- How will you know this worked?
- What metrics will you track?
- What timeline is reasonable?

## Section Guidance
